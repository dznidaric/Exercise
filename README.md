## 1. Anagrams 

### Task
For a given word w and a list of words L, find the number of words in L that are anagrams of w. 

**Input**

List of words L will come in a textual file, one word per line. The program will be called from command line with a filename (to a list of words L) and a word w as arguments.

**Output**

The number of words in L that are anagrams of w.

## 2. Mountain stream

### Task

You are given an infinite stream of points in the Cartesian coordinate system. At every moment, we can do 3 operations:

1. We can input another point by specifying its coordinates
2. We can query the program to give us C points closest to the origin of the coordinate system (point (0, 0))
3. We can terminate the program

**Input**

First line has an integer C which specifies the number of points closest to the origin that we need to print.

After that, we have a potentially infinite stream of 3 possible input lines:

* 1 X Y - adds the point (X, Y) to the stream.
* 2 - query the program for C closest points
* 3 - terminates the program

C, X and Y are all integers with the following constraints:

* C ∈ [1, 106]
* X, Y ∈ [-1000, 1000]


**Output**
For each query, print out the list containing C points closest to the origin in any ordering. Print each point on their own line as one space-separated pair of integers.
